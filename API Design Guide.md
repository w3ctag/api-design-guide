API Design Guide
================
Abstract
--------
The World Wide Web architecture gets more and more complicated with dozens of new web APIs emerging every year. W3C created [the TAG](http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/) to help coordinate cross-technology architecture developments inside and outside W3C.

Setting common principles of Web API design is a major part of the TAG's work. This document is intended to summarize the TAG's expertise and to reflect the TAG's view on the API building process.

This is an unofficial draft and work is in progress.
